## Dnyaneshwari:
The Dnyaneshwari is a commentary on the Bhagavad Gita written by the Marathi saint and poet Dnyaneshwar in the 13th century. This commentary has been praised for its aesthetic as well as scholarly value. The original name of the work is Bhavarth Deepika, which can be roughly translated as "The light showing the internal meaning" (of the Bhagvad Geeta), but it is popularly called the Dnyaneshwari after its creator.

## Haripath:
The Haripath is a collection of twenty-eight abhangas (poems) revealed to the thirteenth-century Marathi Saint, Dnyaneshwar. It is recited by Varkaris each day.
